# nocolor

**NoColor** is an *architecture checking tool* based on the [*concept of colors*](https://github.com/vkcom/nocolor/blob/master/docs/concept_of_colors.md). This concept was originally created
for [KPHP](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp), however, to be usable outside the KPHP, this separate tool was created.

**NoColor** tries to be fast, at the momentâ€”about **100k lines of code per second** on Core i5.

This tool is built on top of [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify) and written in Go.
