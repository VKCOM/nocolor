# nocolor

**NoColor** is an *architecture checking tool* based on the [*concept of colors*](https://github.com/vkcom/nocolor/blob/master/docs/concept_of_colors.md). This concept was originally created for [KPHP](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp), however, to be usable outside the [KPHP](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp), this separate tool was created.

**NoColor** is built with huge codebases in mind, so it scales easily to the capacities provided. At the moment, depending on the number of cores and the speed of the hard disk, **NoColor** can deliver processing speeds from **100 to 300k lines per second**.

This tool is built on top of [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify) and written in **Go**.

See also a [plugin](https://github.com/vkcom/nocolor-phpstorm) for **PhpStorm** that brings in some handy features and checks.
